# Striking the right balance: predicting advertised salary based on previous job listings.
## Introduction
Imagine the scenario. A recruitment agency comes to you with a pitch. They have been in the business for a while, following trends, and manually setting salaries to attract talent across a number of industries at different levels of various companies. The thing is, they have finally caught on to the idea of making data-driven decisions, and they now want you to create a model for their agency to better assign salaries to job listings. Having an accurate salary on a job listing is important for a number of reasons:
1. Offering too little will result in the best talent being "scooped" by other organizations. Additionally, paying staff too little will result in existing staff seeking roles elsewhere and increasing staff turnover, since they will feel undervalued. 
2. In the long run, offering too much salary needlessly affects the organization's profits, while also potentially driving away potential candidates who might think themselves not experienced enough for the role. 

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a model to predict salaries for a set of 1 million new roles provided to you by the recruitment agency, derived from a dataset of 1 million records of previous job advertisements.

In this project you will find the following:
- Data compressed in the `data/` file _to be updated_
- Notebooks detailing the discovery, development, and deployment processes:
    - 01_cf_eda.ipynb : a Jupyter Notebook containing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis
    - 02_cf_model_dev.ipynb : a Jupyter Notebook containing feature engineering, modelling, and model selection _coming soon_
- A pickle file containing the pipeline for new data _coming soon_
- A presentation on the problem and solution _coming soon_
